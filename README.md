# libft

Libft is the first project students encounter in the 42 school curriculum. 

The goal of Libft is to create a library of basic C functions that will be used throughout the rest of the curriculum.

### Project Structure:
The project consists of C files, each containing implementations of specific functions. These functions are grouped into categories such as string manipulation, memory management, and list manipulation.

### Functionality:
The functions implemented in Libft cover a wide range of essential operations including:

* String manipulation (e.g., strlen, strcpy, strcat)
* Memory management (e.g., malloc, free, memset)
* Character classification (e.g., isalpha, isdigit, isalnum)
* Linked list manipulation (e.g., lstnew, lstadd_front, lstsize)
* File manipulation (e.g., write)
